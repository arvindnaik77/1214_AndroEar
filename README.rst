6. About (Short Description / Summary):
		AndroEar, an application for the hearing impaired, will be capable of serving more than 3 million hearing impaired people across the globe. The application provides a set of innovative functionalities, of which the important one being the facility to **convert from text to speech** and from **speech to text** making it easy for the hearing impaired to communicate. The application allows quick switch between both the conversion modes. The specialty of this functionality is the support of more than **75 languages** ,that is, translation to and from these languages to the other. Another innovative idea is to provide an offline ‘**hearing test**’ using which the user gets an idea of what his hearing capacity is which in turn enables him to customize the app in accordance with his personnel requirements (his hearing capacity). The application contains a **set of inspirational quotes** which encourage the physically challenged which scroll beneath the main screen of the application when the app is run in a loop , for we the developers realize the importance of motivating the disabled . The application provides links to **blogs and community sites** dedicated to the physically challenged and specifically the hearing impaired where they meet hearing impaired people from around the globe and will be capable of sharing their views on different aspects of daily life. Finally, the application comes preloaded with a few videos teaching the **‘Hand Gesture’ communication method** along with the facility to retrieve more videos of this genre if interested. A main functionality of the application that requires special mention is that of sending automated messages in cases of emergency. (It is learnt that the hearing impaired , or the disabled in general are not as active or responsive as normal people , such that they wouldn’t find it easy to respond to emergency situations). There comes our AndroEar for Aakash, which will send automated messages to predefined number ( The police or a loved one) saying that the user is in trouble along with the actual location of the user on earth , without using GPS. And this is done by just shaking the device a couple of times, with the force and speed of shake being programmed wisely. Another functionality that requires special mention is that of whistle detection using which the hearing impaired user shall be alerted. Such a facility shall be used in occasions like, for example - considering the scenario of a home having a hearing impaired person and a sick mother who in order to call or alert the hearing person can blow a whistle to cause the Aakash tablet to vibrate which will be felt by the hearing impaired user.

2. Open File Manager in the Aakash tablet.
